# 🤖 Career Advisor AI — Production-Ready GenAI Chatbot

## 📌 Project Title

**Building a Production-Ready Domain-Specific Chatbot using Google Gemini GenAI API**

---

## 📖 Project Overview

This project implements a **production-ready Career Advisor Chatbot** powered by the **Google Gemini GenAI API**.

The chatbot provides domain-specific career guidance through intelligent conversations.
It follows real-world AI engineering practices including modular architecture, secure API handling, session memory, prompt engineering, and cloud deployment.

The objective of this project is to move beyond a basic AI demo and develop a **scalable, secure, and deployable GenAI application**.

## 🎯 Selected Domain

**Career Advisor Chatbot**

The chatbot assists users with:

* Career path suggestions
* Skill development guidance
* Learning roadmap recommendations
* Technology and industry insights
* Personalized career advice through multi-turn conversations

---

## ⚙️ Technical Implementation

### 1. Gemini API Integration

* Integrated **Google Gemini GenAI API**
* Secure API key management using environment variables
* Modular API client (`services/gemini_client.py`)
* Structured request & response handling
* Exception handling and fallback responses
* API logging and monitoring
* Token-efficient prompt usage

---

### 2. Multi-Turn Conversation Memory

* Session-based chat memory
* Context preserved across conversation turns
* Structured history management
* Memory reset on page refresh

Module:

```
memory/session_memory.py
```

---

### 3. Advanced Prompt Engineering

* Role-based system prompting
* Domain-specific career advisor instructions
* Controlled response behavior
* Reusable and configurable prompts

Module:

```
prompts/career_prompt.py
```

---

### 4. Backend Architecture

The application follows **clean architecture principles**:

* Separation of concerns
* Modular design
* Configuration-driven setup
* No hardcoded credentials

Project Modules:

```
config/     → application settings
services/   → Gemini API integration
memory/     → conversation memory
prompts/    → prompt engineering
utils/      → logging utilities
```

---

### 5. User Interface

Built using **Streamlit**

Features:

* Chat-style conversational UI
* Real-time response streaming
* Conversation history display
* Loading indicator
* Light theme interface
* Simple and user-friendly design

Entry File:

```
app.py
```

---

### 6. Cloud Deployment (AWS EC2)

The chatbot is deployed on an **AWS EC2 instance**.

Deployment includes:

* Public IP accessibility
* Environment variable configuration
* Secure API key handling
* Open port configuration
* Background execution of Streamlit app
